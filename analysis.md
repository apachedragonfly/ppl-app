âœ… High-Value Metrics to Track (Instead of Just Total Volume)

ðŸŸ¦ 1. Progressive Overload (Trend Analysis)
What it tracks:

% increase in weight used for key lifts (e.g. Squat, Deadlift, Bench) over time
Moving average across weeks
Plateau detection
Why it's better than raw volume:
Shows whether you're actually getting stronger or just spinning your wheels with junk volume.

ðŸŸ© 2. Volume per Muscle Group (Weekly / Split)
What it tracks:

Weekly volume per body part (e.g. Chest, Quads, Back)
Volume heatmap by day or split
Why it matters:
You can spot overtraining (e.g. 40 sets for shoulders) or neglected muscles (e.g. 6 sets for hamstrings).

ðŸŸ¨ 3. Stimulus-to-Fatigue Ratio (SFR Approximation)
What it tracks:

Tracks isolation vs. compound volume
Tags exercises by SFR tier
Compares "efficiency" of progress (e.g. are you grinding heavy squats with no measurable benefit?)
Why it matters:
Helps refine programming by replacing low-return lifts.

ðŸŸ§ 4. Effort Index / RPE Consistency
What it tracks:

Average RPE across all logged sets
% of sets rated 9â€“10 RPE vs 6â€“7 RPE
Inconsistencies in effort over time
Why it matters:
You can correlate plateaus or burnout with effort trends â€” especially useful if you or Nicole use autoregulation.

ðŸŸ¥ 5. Set Quality (Reps in Reserve Drift)
What it tracks:

Estimated Reps in Reserve (RIR) on each set over time
RIR fatigue curves (e.g. 3â†’1â†’0 RIR over 3 sets)
Compare set fatigue across exercises
Why it matters:
It gives insight into how hard youâ€™re training â€” and where you're likely to hit failure or sandbagging.

ðŸ”µ 6. Lift Efficiency Score (Strength vs Volume)
What it tracks:

Strength per volume ratio (1RM Ã— sets Ã· total volume)
Identifies exercises giving most return for time invested
Why it matters:
You can highlight whatâ€™s giving results vs whatâ€™s wasting recovery bandwidth.

ðŸŸ£ 7. Injury Risk / Recovery Load Trends (if HRV or subjective recovery is logged)
What it tracks:

Recovery index based on volume spikes or missed workouts
Detects overreaching
Warns of sudden week-to-week increases in load
Why it matters:
Better programming decisions and tapering, especially for Nicoleâ€™s case (PCOS, fatigue sensitivity, etc.).

ðŸ”¢ Bonus: Useful Visual Formats

Metric	Ideal Visualization
Volume per muscle group	Heatmap or stacked bar chart
Strength trends	Line chart with PR flags
RPE drift per workout	Area chart or slope graph
Overload efficiency	Scatterplot: volume vs 1RM gains
Recovery/load spikes	Calendar grid with intensity shading
TL;DR â€” Most Valuable to Track:
Progressive overload trends
Per-muscle group volume
RPE/RIR consistency
SFR-based lift efficiency
Strength-to-volume ratios
